# Energy_Consumption_Analysis

## Data Overview: 


Analyzing individual household electric power consumption dataset.

The dataset is based on 2,075,259 measurements gathered in a house located in Sceaux (7km of Paris, France) between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months).

The purpose of this study is to detect possible patterns in energy consumption by analyzing sub-meters readings 
which will allow the client to allocating costs to cut, or distribute the consumption on different periods of time.

## Defining the Attributes:

- date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
- time: time in format hh:mm:ss
- global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
- global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
- voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
- global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
- sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
- sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
- sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.


## Data pre-processing:

Since the data in 2006 was based only on the month of December, therefore, during the data pre-processing, 
the year 2006 was excluded.

Data range was based on January 2007 till November 2010.

You can’t manage what you can’t measure, therefore, analyzing the energy consumption will lead to:

- Accurate energy monitoring, real-time energy consumption. 
- Granular in-depth review of household energy data. 
- Better informed to make decisions that can help optimize energy performance. 
- Ability to record actual energy usage (no estimates). 
- Comparison of usage across similar households over time. 
- Ability to identify and eliminate wasted energy.

Part of this project was made by using Tableau to generate some visual graphs and a dashboard.
