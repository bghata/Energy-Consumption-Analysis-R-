# Energy-Consumption-Analysis-R-
In this project, I worked on 47 months of data from a household in France involving 3 sub-meters, 
and I used R to be able to do my analysis and visualizations.

The purpose of this study is to detect possible patterns in energy consumption by analyzing sub-meters readings 
which will allow the client to allocating costs to cut, or distribute the consumption on different periods of time.

You can’t manage what you can’t measure, therefore, analyzing the energy consumption will lead to:

- Accurate energy monitoring, real-time energy consumption. 
- Granular in-depth review of household energy data. 
- Better informed to make decisions that can help optimize energy performance. 
- Ability to record actual energy usage (no estimates). 
- Comparison of usage across similar households over time. 
- Ability to identify and eliminate wasted energy.

Part of this project was made by using Tableau to generate some visual graphs and a dashboard.
